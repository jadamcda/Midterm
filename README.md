# Midterm

Couldn't get it all the way done since I'm so behind on the projects and ran out of time and energy before I could figure out how to record high scores.
Also inexplicably view binding and toasts were not working for me despite everything looking correct to my knowledge, and could not ask TAs what was wrong, so had to improvise for functionallity.
But hey I did my best.
